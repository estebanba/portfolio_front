            Full Stack Web Developer with a sensibility for human-centred
            design, user experience and multidisciplinarity as key values to
            create meaningful and impactful products.

            Architect sharing my passion about technology, digitalization and
            data driven design, which I believe are essential to bring the built

          <h4>My Background</h4>
          <p>
            I have graduated as an Architect from the University of Buenos Aires
          </p>
          <p>
            In my first 3 years of professional practice I have worked side by
            side with a group of highly creative architects and designers at{" "}

            , jointly conceiving and developing during this period more than 10
            projects of great interest due to their design value.
          </p>
          <p>
            The focus was on social impact and sustainability through the
            exploration, for example, of daring proposals of space articulation,
            experimentation with modular systems and the use of new technologies
            together with alternative materials.
          </p>

          <p>
            From this friendship and partnership I value having formed a
            well-rounded profile as a designer and entrepreneur, but above all
            having developed an independent and critical mindset.
          </p>
          <p> In 2018 I moved to Berlin </p>
          <p>
            More recently, the last 3 years have been a practice of a completely
            different kind, in which I have had the opportunity to work on
            various projects for the colossus of e-commerce, the construction of
            logistics centers of up to 100,000 m2, in which the focus was on
            fulfilling high client standards and strict German regulations.
