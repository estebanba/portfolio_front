          <p>
            I'm a Creative Developer with a sensibility for human-centred
            design, user experience and multidisciplinarity, which I think are
            key values to create meaningful and impactful products.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the same time also an Architect who is into Tech and loves
            sharing his passion about technology, digitalization and data driven
            design, which I believe are essential to bring the built environment
            to the 21th century.

          <h4>My Background</h4>
          {/* <p>
            I grew up in Gobernador Virasoro, a small city in north-eastern
            Argentina, between fields of tea, yerba-mate and eucalyptus. In a
            nutshell: hot weather, landscapes painted red and green, and
            warm-hearted people, my childhood, spent between nature and video
            games.
          </p> */}
          <p>
            Graduating with a degree in Architecture and Urbanism from the
            University of Buenos Aires in 2015, I jumped straight into working
            independently, side by side with a group of very talented and
            creative architects and designers at{" "}
            <a
              href="https://irarquitectura.com/"
              target="_blank"

            >
              IR&nbsp;Arquitectura
            </a>
            , jointly conceiving and developing during this period more than 10
            projects of great interest due to the design thinking process
            involved.
          </p>
          <p>
            The focus was on achieving social impact and sustainability through
            the exploration of space articulation, modular systems and new
            technologies combined with alternative materials.
          </p>

          <p>
            From this collaboration, friendship and partnership I value the most
            having formed a well-rounded profile as a designer and entrepreneur,
            but above all having developed an independent and critical mindset.
          </p>
          <p>
            In late 2018 I moved to Berlin seduced by it's mix of cosmopolitan
            vibes and german values, and to improve my language skills.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following 3 years have been professionally of a completely
            different kind, in which I have had the opportunity to work in a
            corporate environment, on construction projects for Amazon, such as
            logistics centers of up to 100,000 m2 each, in which the challenge
            was to fulfill our client high standards and the strict German
            regulations, at the same time.
          </p>
          <p>
            As BIM lead at{" "}
            <a

              target="_blank"

            </a>{" "}
            I was responsible for the digital processes and data integrity of
            the projects, making the software reach it's limits and creating
            custom scripts to solve a specific need. The techie in me grew while
            promoting the digital transformation of the company and among my
            colleagues.
          </p>
          <h4>My Present</h4>
          <p>
            During these years in Architecture and the construction industry I
            found, on a daily basis, a strong resistance to digitalization
            within a slightly conservative industry that relies too much on
            outdated and inefficient processes.
          </p>
          <p>
            I decided that in order to help bridge these gaps I would dive into
            learning to code and become a developer, building real applications,
            becoming part of the amazing community and learning a bunch of cool
            tools on the way.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            I am now working in the intersection between design and technology,
            where I can better put my skills in action to create meaningful
            digital products that actually make a difference and improve the way
            we achieve things.
          </p>

          <h4>Wellbeing</h4>
          <p>
            Besides being at the computer for hours a day, I like to stretch my
            legs from time to time, travelling and getting out to take photos. I
            shoot anytime with my phone, but sometimes I like to get fancy and
            go out with my Canon T3i and 50mm lens.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have incorporated Yoga into my life, bringing with it more balance
            and joy. No matter where or when, I make space and time for
            Meditation, Paranayama y Asana.
          </p>
          <p>
            Last but not least, I love cycling, taking care of my house plants,
            reading books and their modern version, movies and series, or any
            other format that can tell a good story. I also like engaging in
            interesting conversations, and fortunately we could have them in
            Spanish, English and now in German (work in progress).
          </p>
